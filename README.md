    ┌───────────────────────┒    Bombshell builds delightful tools for the
    │                       ┃    JavaScript ecosystem. We're simplifying a
    │     ●* BOMBSHELL      ┃    historically underappreciated technology:
    │                       ┃    the command line interface. It's time for
    ┕━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛    us to demand delightful shell experiences
    

   ▶ EVERYONE IS VALUED HERE ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─

     at the end of the day, we only have each other. we must support those
     who are already present, lift as we climb, and welcome others to join

     being inclusive requires being intolerant of hateful, divisive people


   ▶ SOFTWARE IS AN ART FORM ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─

     when computers can crank out code for us, we are obligated to embrace
     the art behind building software. thoughtful creativity sets us apart

     there's no science to magical experiences–it just takes care and luck


   ▶ FUN IS QUITE SERIOUS  ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─

     look-there's enough bullshit to wade through out in the world. we can
     provide moments of calm and delight among all the chaos. that matters

     give yourself extra space. moments of joy can make the grind worth it


   ▶ TRUST IS NON-NEGOTIABLE ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─ ─

     communities are built on trust and trust demands transparency. we can
     make decisions in the open because there is nothing that needs hiding

     trust your gut. honor your conscience. integrity is worth more than $
